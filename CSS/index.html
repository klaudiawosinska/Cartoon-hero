	<h2>About Wonder Woman</h2>
	<p>Wonder Woman tells the tale of Princess Diana of Themyscira. Her original origin story says she was formed out of clay by her mother, Hippolyta, and had life bestowed upon her by the Greek gods â€” making her the only Amazon not conceived by a man. She grows up free of men on Paradise Island where the Amazons teach her warrior skills as well as lessons of love and peace. The gods also gift Diana with powers including strength, wisdom, courage, a hunter's heart, beauty, sisterhood, speed, and flight.</p>
